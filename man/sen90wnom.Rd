\title{
  90th U.S. Senate Ideal Points
}

\description{
  This dataframe contains the estimated ideal points of the 90th U.S Senate
  using \code{wnominate}.  Although it can easily be obtained from calling
  the example in \code{wnominate}, it is included here to facilitate illustration
  of the examples for the plot and summary functions.

\usage{
data(sen90wnom)
}

\value{
    An object of class \code{nomObject}, which in this documentation is also referred to
    as a W-NOMINATE object.

  \item{legislators}{ data frame, containing all data from the old \code{nom33.dat} file about
        legislators. For a typical W-NOMINATE object run with an ORD file read using
        \code{readKH}, it will contain the following:
    \itemize{
    \item \code{state} State name of legislator.
    \item \code{icpsrState} ICPSR state code of legislator.
    \item \code{cd} Congressional District number.
    \item \code{icpsrLegis} ICPSR code of legislator.
    \item \code{party} Party of legislator. 
    \item \code{partyCode} ICPSR party code of legislator.
    \item \code{correctYea} Predicted Yeas and Actual Yeas.
    \item \code{wrongYea} Predicted Yeas and Actual Nays.
    \item \code{wrongNay} Predicted Nays and Actual Yeas.
    \item \code{correctNay} Predicted Nays and Actual Nays.
    \item \code{GMP} Geometric Mean Probability.
    \item \code{PRE} Proportional Reduction In Error.
    \item \code{coord1D} First dimension W-NOMINATE score, with all subsequent dimensions numbered similarly.
    \item \code{se1D} Bootstrapped standard error of first dimension W-NOMINATE score, with all subsequent dimensions numbered similarly.  This will be empty if trials is set below 4. 
    \item \code{corr.1} Covariance between first and second dimension W-NOMINATE score, with all subsequent dimensions numbered similarly.}
  }

  \item{rollcalls}{ data frame, containing all data from the old \code{nom33.dat} file about
                    bills. For a typical W-NOMINATE object run with an ORD file read
                    using \code{readKH}, it will contain the following:
    \itemize{
    \item \code{correctYea} Predicted Yeas and Actual Yeas.
    \item \code{wrongYea} Predicted Yeas and Actual Nays.
    \item \code{wrongNay} Predicted Nays and Actual Yeas.
    \item \code{correctNay} Predicted Nays and Actual Nays.
    \item \code{GMP} Geometric Mean Probability.
    \item \code{PRE} Proportional Reduction In Error.
    \item \code{spread1D} First dimension W-NOMINATE spread, with all subsequent dimensions
                    numbered similarly.
    \item \code{midpoint1D} First dimension W-NOMINATE midpoint, with all subsequent dimensions
                    numbered similarly.
   } }                     

  \item{dimensions}{ integer, number of dimensions estimated. }
  \item{eigenvalues}{ A vector of roll call eigenvalues. }
  \item{beta}{ The beta value used in the final iteration. }
  \item{weights}{ A vector of weights used in each iteration. }
  \item{fits}{ A vector of length 3*dimensions with the classic measures of fit.
                In order, it contains the correct classifications for each dimension,
                the APREs for each dimension, and the overall GMPs for each dimension.}
